### ðŸ“… 2025-05-09 â€“ Component Setup & Page Responsibilities

* We divided the main client pages according to the project requirements.

* Therese began by building the first atomic components: **BaseInput** and **BaseButton**.

* She is responsible for the shared layout and user-related pages:

  * **Landing page**, **Header**, **Navigation/Menu**
  * **Login** and **Register** views
  * **User dashboard ("My Pages")** in the admin panel

* Johannes and Alexandra are continuing to build their respective feature areas:

  * **Books** (Johannes): book list, individual book pages, and book admin views
  * **Reviews** (Alexandra): create and list reviews tied to each book

> We'll update the task division as designs are finalized and implementation progresses.

**Plan** : upload db exports and try setup on monday may 12th, 2025
